     * loop, but uses a call to LockSupport.parkNanos(1) in the middle of the loop. On a typical Linux system this will pause the thread for around 60Âµs.
     * However it has the benefit that the producing thread does not need to take any action other increment the appropriate counter and does not require the
     * cost of signalling a condition variable. However, the mean latency of moving the event between the producer and consumer threads will be higher. It works
     * best in situations where low latency is not required, but a low impact on the producing thread is desired. A common use case is for asynchronous logging.
